# ARCHIVED

Plugin Requests are now closed.

We have enough requests that all good and useful plugins have already been requested.
99% of new requests are duplicate, not possible, or just useless and thus no longer productive.

As such, we are not accepting any new requests at this time.

### FAQ:
- Is there any other way to make requests?
  - No.
- Can I post requests in the Discord Server instead?
  - No.
- When will these existing requests be fulfilled?
  - Whenever someone does and it gets merged.
